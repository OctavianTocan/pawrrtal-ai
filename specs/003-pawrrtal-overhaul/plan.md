# Implementation Plan: Pawrrtal Platform Overhaul — Program / Architecture Plan

**Branch**: `003-pawrrtal-overhaul` | **Date**: 2026-06-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/003-pawrrtal-overhaul/spec.md`

> **Plan altitude.** `003` is an umbrella spec, so this is a **program / architecture plan**, not a single buildable implementation plan. It resolves the *cross-cutting* research (Phase 0) and locks the *shared design* every story inherits (Phase 1): the four shared contracts, the thin-core package decomposition, the self-hosted substrates, and the incremental migration sequence. **Per-feature task lists (`/speckit-tasks`) and implementation happen per split spec** — see Complexity Tracking and the Sequencing Roadmap. This keeps the constitution's reviewable-increments principle intact: this plan ships nothing; it makes the splits coherent.

## Summary

Converge Pawrrtal onto a **tiny Effect-TS kernel + a small set of packages (kernel · `api-core` contracts · host) + capabilities as discovered files/data**, fronted by **one normalized gateway** that drives any model or full agent CLI, with **sandboxed execution**, **self-hosted secrets**, and the **removal** of the permission/budget/telemetry/workspace systems — migrating off Python via the **existing `backend-ts/` strangler** (Python `:8000` canonical, Effect `:8001` coexisting behind stable HTTP contracts). The technical approach is **continuity, not greenfield**: `backend-ts/` already encodes the `api-core`(contract)/`apps/api`(runtime) split, the Service/Repo/Body/Live patterns, Effect SQL, and cookie auth — with exactly one of ~21 Python route groups (Projects) ported. This plan locks the contracts and the decomposition so each split spec extends that one proven slice instead of re-deciding the architecture.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: End-state **TypeScript on Effect v4 (effect-smol)**; today Python 3.13/FastAPI (strangler coexistence). Frontend Next.js 15/React 19; mobile React Native/Expo (Story 15). *Version reconciliation needed:* `backend-ts` pins `effect@4.0.0-beta.74`; `../use-agy` pins `beta.85` — diff vendored revisions before copying signatures. **This drift is elevated to a PUBLISH BLOCKER for the SDK:** the internal boundary still picks ONE pin now, but there is **no publish until a stable non-`unstable`/non-`beta` Effect pin** lands and the `beta.74`↔`beta.85` gap is resolved to a single `peerDependency` range at the publish gate.

**Primary Dependencies**: `effect` v4 unstable surfaces (`effect/unstable/httpapi`, `effect/unstable/http`, `effect/unstable/rpc` — client/server protocol layers), `@effect/platform-bun`, `@effect/platform-browser` (`BrowserSocket` for the WS RPC transport; `BrowserWorker`/`BrowserWorkerRunner` for the deferred local MessagePort path), `@effect/vitest`; Bun; Biome. Source-of-truth for every signature = `backend/vendor/effect-smol` submodule (never guess an API).

**Storage**: **PURE FILES — no database at all.** Conversations, profiles, projects, memory, config, and the `.agent/` workspace tree are all plain files under a single **`$PAWRRTAL_DATA`** root (a **git repo** for backups/history). NO Postgres, NO SQLite, NO Alembic for app data. Conversations are a per-conversation `meta.json` + append-only `messages.jsonl` (the `chat_messages` rows map 1:1 by `ordinal`); ledgers/audit/cost become append-only JSONL logs. **Search = ripgrep/scan over the JSONL — there is no index** (slower-search-at-scale tradeoff explicitly accepted). A **core-light `FileStore` service over effect-smol `FileSystem.ts` (+ `KeyValueStore.layerFileSystem(dir)`)** owns persistence. Alembic stops owning app data; a one-shot SQLAlchemy→file-tree exporter writes the file tree once.

**Testing**: `@effect/vitest` (**must first fix the latent-broken backend-ts gate** — drop `--passWithNoTests`, make `it.effect` suites collect, de-duplicate the divergent `test/Modules/**` vs `test/unit/**` trees); `pytest` (Python until retired); the **visual verification harness** (Story 11 / spec 002) as the rendering gate; `paw verify`; `sentrux`/import-boundary checks (now enforced as package boundaries).

**Target Platform**: Backend service (`:8000` Python → `:8001` Effect), web app, Telegram/Google Chat channels, `paw` CLI, mobile.

**Deployment & clients**: backend on the **VPS**, exposed via **`tailscale serve`** (tailnet-only, never `funnel`; bound to `127.0.0.1`) — **Cloudflare Access is retired for app/API and the public website is deferred** (no brochure path now). **Identity = profiles + the spoof-proof `Tailscale-User-Login` header** that `serve` injects (trustworthy because the backend is loopback-bound and serve strips client copies); a profile MAY carry an **optional per-profile bearer** for password-locked profiles, held by the Electron main process and never exposed to the renderer. **Desktop = Electron** whose renderer uses **ONE Effect-RPC client over WebSocket** (`RpcClient.layerProtocolSocket` + `BrowserSocket.layerWebSocket(wss://<node>.ts.net/rpc)`) to the tailnet backend; the **MessagePort/local-runtime path** (`RpcClient.layerProtocolWorker` + `BrowserWorker.layer` to an Electron `utilityProcess`) is **DEFERRED post-v1**. The hardened `contextBridge` brokers the (deferred) MessagePort handshake + privileged native ops only — never the data path. **Mobile = Expo** over the same WS RPC. electron-builder + electron-updater + in-app update prompt. See [research.md](./research.md) §§9–11 (§8 superseded).

**Project Type**: Full-stack monorepo — **tiny kernel + ~3 packages (kernel · `api-core` · host) + discovered capabilities + decoupled client apps** (web/mobile/CLI consume a generated typed client only). The **kernel is the (internally-published) SDK** consumed by `apps/api` + `apps/paw` through the contract; the app→SDK arrow is build-enforced (see Structure Decision).

**API surface**: one contract (`api-core`) → **HTTP** (`HttpApi`, auto-OpenAPI via `OpenApi.fromApi(Api)` + Scalar docs) **and Effect RPC** (RpcGroups beside the HttpApi groups), both from the same `Domain`. **The Effect-RPC surface IS the desktop/web/mobile client transport** — reached via `RpcClient` over `RpcClient.layerProtocolSocket` (WebSocket for v1; the MessagePort local-runtime layer is deferred per Deployment), with **`AtomRpc.Service` as the reactive renderer binding**. A **typed client** is also generated (`@hey-api/openapi-ts` → the read-only `api-client` package) for HTTP consumers. **Decomposition**: a thin core (`@platform/*` + `kernel` + `api-core`) + small uniform **`@clients/*`** packages (one per external SDK) + product sub-domain packages; comcom file conventions (`Domain·Api·Errors·RpcProtocol` contract / `Service·Repo·Policy·Http·Rpc` host; **no `index.ts` barrels**, `exports: "./*"`, `catalog:`/`workspace:*`).

**Performance Goals**: Domain-appropriate, small-now scale (first visible stream token < ~2s, per spec SC-001). Not designed for high-concurrency public multi-tenancy yet.

**Constraints**: **Default fully self-hosted** (Clarification Q1) — self-hosted Infisical, own-infra sandboxes, **no external AI gateway**. **Files-first persistence (no DB)** — all app data lives in the `$PAWRRTAL_DATA` file tree via `FileStore`; no Postgres/SQLite/Alembic. **Trusted users only** (Q2) — agent/model-generated *code* still sandbox-isolated (**`local-confined` default; Docker+gVisor/Kata/E2B opt-in tiers**). **Total migration** (Q3) — no Python in the end-state.

**Scale/Scope**: A handful of trusted self-hosted users; 16 stories; ~20 Python route groups to migrate; current backend is ~80% already the target shape (manifest plugin platform, AILLM Protocol, channel-agnostic runner).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: evaluated before Phase 0 and re-checked after Phase 1.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| I. Evidence Before Claims | **PASS** | Every decision here is grounded in cited code (research.md): the strangler, the parts vocabularies, the substrate facts. Unknowns are listed, not guessed. |
| II. Preserve Architecture Boundaries | **PASS (reinforced)** | The plan's core thesis *is* boundary enforcement — promoting the advisory `no-tools-in-providers` / extension-boundaries / sentrux rules into **build-enforced package boundaries**. Optional integrations stay outside the kernel by construction. |
| III. Design System Consistency | **N/A here** | This program plan is backend/architecture; UI-touching stories (12, 15) defer DESIGN.md alignment to their own split specs. |
| IV. Gates Travel With the Change | **PASS (with a flagged defect)** | Each split slice names its gate (typecheck, `@effect/vitest`, harness compare, `paw verify`, sentrux). **The latent-broken backend-ts test gate is a defect this plan owns as Roadmap Step 0** — not deferred as "pre-existing." |
| V. Reviewable, Incremental Delivery | **PASS (via stacked PRs)** | See Complexity Tracking. The umbrella plan locks shared contracts only; the **maintainer-agent implements every slice as small, parallel-stacked PRs, each independently gated** (typecheck, `@effect/vitest`, harness, `paw verify`, sentrux). The per-split-spec decomposition is a **sequencing device, not an ownership boundary**. No mega-implementation. |

**Result:** PASS. The only violation (one plan spanning 16 stories) is justified in Complexity Tracking and neutralized by per-split decomposition.

### Source Code (target — thin core + small uniform packages in clean namespaces + decoupled clients)

> **Reconciling the references.** nanoclaw is ~2 packages; comcom is ~125; both are "elegant." Resolution: **"thin" is about the *core*, not the package count.** Keep the **foundation + the loop** tiny and zero-dependency (nanoclaw/Eve), then grow by adding **many small, single-responsibility packages in strict namespace layers** (comcom) so the dependency DAG reads off the namespace prefix. Pawrrtal adopts comcom's *layering + conventions + the 3-way capability rule*, but **starts with few packages** and adds one small package at a time. `backend-ts` already has the seam (`api-core` + `apps/api`). See [research.md](./research.md) §7.

# THIN CORE (stays tiny + stable — the part that must be "really really thin")
# ── PUBLISHABLE UNIT (internal in v1): kernel + api-core + @clients/* + the `paw` AGENT group.
#    This IS the publishable-shaped SDK boundary; we name it publishable-shaped and BUILD-ENFORCE the
#    app→SDK dependency arrow now, but ship nothing public yet (publish DEFERRED, NOT CHOSEN — see Step 6
#    + the publish blocker in Technical Context). The SDK imports NO app/runtime/host code: the arrow points
#    apps/api + apps/paw → SDK, never back. Keep the `pawrrtal`/`@pawrrtal/*` scope internally; an
#    `agentkit` scope is aliased ONLY at publish-time, never squatted now.
@platform/*        effect · config · database · models · server · auth   — zero internal deps; shared by all runtimes.
                   Lives at packages/platform.   [NEW — only api-core + apps/api exist today]
@pawrrtal/kernel   the agent-harness / SDK CORE — sits ABOVE api-core in the publishable unit: ONE legible turn loop
                   (build context → call provider → dispatch tools → emit parts → park/continue/terminate) + a
                   compaction policy + the narrow ports as interfaces only (provider · tool+permission-check · channel ·
                   sandbox · file/session store · secret · memory · observability). Imports nothing concrete; ships
                   trivial reference impls only (LocalConfinedRuntime · node-FS FileStore · dev provider stub).
                   Lives at packages/kernel.   [NEW]   (comcom names this @comcom/agent-harness)
@pawrrtal/api-core the CONTRACT — per-module Domain.ts · Api.ts (HttpApi) · Errors.ts (httpApiStatus) · RpcProtocol.ts.
                   Runtime-free. ⇒ auto-OpenAPI + auto typed-client + Effect RPC, all from these types.   [EXISTS]
@pawrrtal/api-client  GENERATED typed client (openapi.json → @hey-api/openapi-ts, or HttpApiClient). Never hand-edited.
                   Lives at packages/api-client.   [NEW]

# SMALL UNIFORM PACKAGES (grow one at a time; each single-responsibility; strict DAG by namespace)
@clients/*         one tiny Effect wrapper per external SDK/service — Client · Config · Errors, depends only on
                   @platform/effect:  anthropic · gemini · xai · codex · opencode · e2b · infisical · fireflies ·
                   mcp · ai-sdk · acp · …   ← providers + integrations live HERE (not "plugins", not in the kernel).
                   ALL live under packages/clients/* (a curated STARTER SUBSET ships only at publish-time).
                   Part of the publishable unit.   [NEW — glob packages/clients/*]
@pawrrtal/*        product sub-domains, one responsibility each: app-core (frontend business logic) · app-shared (UI) ·
                   sandbox · secrets · sync · transcription · …   (comcom: @comcom/{app-core,sandbox,sync,…})

# RUNTIMES + CLIENTS (apps compose packages — these depend ON the SDK; the arrow never points back)
apps/api           HOST: server/ module impls (Service · Repo · Policy · Http · Rpc), discover→registry, serve
                   /openapi.json + Scalar /docs, persistence + auth + sessions + delivery at the EDGE.   [EXISTS, :8001]
apps/worker        background/scheduled runtime (optional; same contract).
apps/web           Next.js  — imports @pawrrtal/api-client + app-core only. NO backend imports.   [NEW]
apps/mobile        Expo     — same contract, generated client.   [NEW]
apps/paw           ONE `paw` binary, two groups — do NOT split: the AGENT group (new · dev --no-ui · run --payload ·
                   build · info) is KERNEL-ONLY by construction and is part of the publishable unit (aliased as an
                   `agentkit` bin at publish); the OPERATOR group (verify · lab · live-ops · profiles) is a Pawrrtal
                   HTTP/RPC client of the contract and stays in the app. Today Python at backend/app/cli/paw.   [NEW]

# CAPABILITIES — by the comcom 3-way rule (who owns/changes it decides where it lives):
#   user-added, runtime   → DB rows (skills, agents, user tools), injected into context at runtime
#   team-curated catalog  → declarative registry DATA in api-core (provider catalog · MCP catalog · integration apps) — metadata, no code
#   core business         → an in-trunk code module (the turn loop, conversations, projects)
#   external SDK          → a @clients/<service> package
```

**One contract, two transports:** each module's `Domain.ts` feeds **`Api.ts` (HttpApi → public REST + auto-OpenAPI, for web/mobile/external + the OpenAI/Anthropic gateway façade)** *and* **`RpcProtocol.ts` (Effect RPC → typed internal calls, e.g. the kernel↔host agent stream)** — both derived from the same types.

**File conventions (comcom):** contract module = `Domain.ts · Api.ts · Errors.ts · RpcProtocol.ts · [Events.ts]`; host module = `Service.ts · Repo.ts · Policy.ts · Http.ts · Rpc.ts`. PascalCase folders/files; complex domains nest (`Integrations/Domain/Substrate/`, `Catalog/`). **No `index.ts` barrels** — `exports: { "./*": "./src/*.ts" }`, callers import `@pawrrtal/api-core/Modules/Sessions/Domain` directly. Shared dep versions via `catalog:`; internal deps via `workspace:*`. Tests in `test/` at package root.

**Auto-generated OpenAPI + typed client (first-class, exact pipeline):** `OpenApi.fromApi(Api)` → a committed `openapi.json` → `@hey-api/openapi-ts` → the **`@pawrrtal/api-client` package** (read-only, regenerated on API change) → `@pawrrtal/app-core` (hooks/business logic) → frontends. Errors' `httpApiStatus` → error responses; middleware `security` → schemes; `OpenApi.annotations` → summaries; Scalar docs at `/docs`. **No hand-written spec; never hand-edit the generated client.**

**Structure Decision**: Partition by **code vs. data**, layer by **namespace**, and keep the *core* thin — not the package count. The test for any candidate package: *does it change when you add an agent / provider / channel / tool?* If yes → it is a **`@clients/*` wrapper, a registry-data file, or a DB row** (per the 3-way rule), never the kernel. If it is *this-tailnet / this-profile / this-`$PAWRRTAL_DATA`*-specific → it is the **app**, not the SDK. The thin core (`@platform/*` + `kernel` + `api-core`) stays tiny and stable; the system grows by adding small uniform packages + catalog data + DB rows. `projects/conversations/settings` are host role-folders; providers/integrations are `@clients/*`; the kernel imports nothing concrete (build-enforced). The subtraction stories (#17–19) are what *let* the core be this thin.

**The publishable SDK boundary is build-enforced now (publish itself is DEFERRED, NOT CHOSEN).** The **publishable unit** = `kernel` + `api-core` + `@clients/*` + the `paw` AGENT group; we name it publishable-shaped and enforce the **app→SDK dependency arrow** (`apps/api` + `apps/paw` → SDK) so the SDK imports **no app/runtime/host code** — but we ship nothing public in v1. Publishing waits on four gates: (1) the four shared contracts API-frozen for 2+ cycles, (2) a stable non-`unstable`/non-`beta` Effect pin (the publish blocker in Technical Context), (3) 2+ in-repo consumers through the generated contract, (4) an external party asking. The GATEWAY is the only split entity — the internal parts envelope is SDK, the external OpenAI/Anthropic façade is app. **First mechanical step:** widen `backend-ts/package.json` workspaces to include `packages/clients/*` and add `kernel` + `platform` (workspace-protocol deps, `catalog:` versions, no `index.ts` barrels).

**Deployment & client connection (research §§9–11) — decisions locked.** The earlier **Next-standalone-`loadURL` + `desktop:apiFetch` HTTP-proxy + `safeStorage`-bearer + per-route-CORS + Cloud|Local|Custom base-URL machinery is SUPERSEDED.** The new locked decisions:

- **`tailscale serve` (tailnet-only) replaces Cloudflare Access for the app/API** — the backend is bound to `127.0.0.1` and exposed only over the tailnet (never `funnel`); **a public website is deferred, not chosen**. No CORS / cookie-domain concerns (the renderer rides WSS RPC, not cross-origin HTTP).
- **Profiles replace cookie/bearer login.** Identity = a `Tailscale-User-Login` header (spoof-proof: loopback-bound backend, `serve` strips client copies) + an `X-Pawrrtal-Profile: <id>` header on every request. A profile MAY carry an **optional password**; unlocking it returns a short-lived **opaque bearer used only for password-locked profiles**, held by the **Electron main process and never exposed to the renderer**.
- **The renderer reaches the backend through ONE Effect-RPC contract over WebSocket (v1)** — `RpcClient.layerProtocolSocket` + `BrowserSocket.layerWebSocket(wss://<node>.ts.net/rpc)`, with streaming as Effect `Stream` returns (ack-based backpressure + interrupt cancellation), **not** `ipcMain.invoke`/`webContents.send`. The **MessagePort local-runtime transport** (`RpcClient.layerProtocolWorker` + `BrowserWorker.layer` to an Electron `utilityProcess`) is **DEFERRED post-v1** as the future local-first option.
- **`contextBridge` / `sandbox` stay the security floor** (`contextIsolation:true, sandbox:true, nodeIntegration:false`, validated `event.senderFrame`, never exposes `ipcRenderer`) — the handshake that brokers the one-time (deferred) MessagePort handoff + privileged native ops, **never the data path**.
- **Mobile = Expo** over the same WS RPC.
- **Distribution unchanged:** electron-builder per-OS (mac dmg arm64+x64, win nsis, linux AppImage; `asar:true`) + **electron-updater** with an **in-app `update-downloaded` → AppDialog prompt → `quitAndInstall()`** (no silent install; capture window/session state before update); signed/notarized (CSC_*/APPLE_*); on the OctavianTocan-gated self-hosted runner, with the **macOS notarize leg as the one gated `macos-latest` exception**.
- **Reconcile first:** the stale `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-03-26-electron-desktop-app.md` (Vite + `file://` + cookie-domain hack + sidecar) is **superseded**; create the greenfield `electron/` workspace (main window · preload validated `window.pawrrtal` handshake · the runtime entry for the DEFERRED local path) — referenced by `next.config.ts`/`dev-ports.ts` but not on disk this session (confirm whether a branch has it first).

## Phase 0 — Outline & Research → [research.md](./research.md)

Six fronts, all grounded in existing code, consolidated as Decision/Rationale/Alternatives in `research.md`:

1. **Existing Effect strangler** — build on `backend-ts/`; extend the Projects slice pattern; next slices from `router_registry.py` `_ROUTER_FACTORIES`; **fix the falsely-green test gate**.
2. **Effect v4 style (`../use-agy`)** — mirror the *compiling code* (Context.Service, Schema.TaggedErrorClass, `Effect.fn` span naming, layer/testLayer/fakeLayer, module file set), not the stale v3-flavored docs; reconcile beta.74↔.85 against `vendor/effect-smol`.
3. **Thin-core decomposition** — *refined by #7 below*: a tiny kernel (one loop + 3 ports) + ~3 packages (kernel · `api-core` · host); capabilities are **discovered files/data, not packages**; partition by **code vs. data**; the kernel imports nothing concrete (build-enforced); mirror into `backend-ts` `@pawrrtal/*`.
4. **Shared contracts** — collapse the 4 current event vocabularies onto `parts[]`; ModelProvider/AgentProvider taxonomy + capability manifest; session record + single context-owner; gateway internal-parts + external OpenAI/Anthropic façade.
5. **Self-hosted substrates** — self-hosted Infisical (Docker Compose + Machine Identity Universal Auth + `infisical run`), two secret planes kept separate; **`local-confined` default sandbox** (constrained CWD + network-off via OS primitives like bubblewrap, no container/image); **Docker+gVisor / Kata / E2B opt-in tiers; Upstash Box opt-in only** (managed-cloud, conflicts with self-hosted); no external gateway.
6. **Persistence + migration** — **files-first (`FileStore` over effect-smol `FileSystem.ts`)**; **NO database** (search = ripgrep/scan over the JSONL, no index); **no Postgres/SQLite/Alembic for app data**; the **`$PAWRRTAL_DATA` data root is a git repo**; extraction order Projects → read-only CRUD → paw CLI → message-write → streaming chat last.
7. **Thin-core references (nanoclaw · Eve · effect-smol · comcom)** — "thin = thin *core*, not few packages": **namespace-layered** packages with a tiny `@platform/*` + `kernel` + `api-core`; providers/integrations as uniform **`@clients/*`** packages; the **3-way capability rule** (user→DB · team→registry data · core→code module); **one contract → HTTP + RPC + auto-OpenAPI + generated client**; fully **decoupled frontends**. Refines #3.

## Phase 1 — Design & Contracts

- **Shared entities** → [data-model.md](./data-model.md)
- **The 4 shared contracts** → [contracts/](./contracts/) (message-parts · provider-taxonomy · session-record · gateway) — these are the load-bearing artifacts every split spec conforms to.
- **Validation guide** → [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md)
- **Agent context**: the SpecKit-managed plan reference in the agent context file is refreshed via the optional `after_plan` hook (`/speckit-agent-context-update`) rather than hand-editing the curated `CLAUDE.md`.

**Constitution re-check (post-design):** PASS — the contracts and decomposition *strengthen* boundary preservation (II) and keep delivery decomposable (V); no new violations introduced.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|---|---|---|
| One plan spanning all 16 stories (vs one plan per feature) | The maintainer directed a single master spec; the **cross-cutting contracts** (parts model, taxonomy, session, gateway) and the **package decomposition + migration sequence** are shared by every story and must be decided *once* and *coherently*. | Planning each feature first would re-derive these same shared contracts N times and risk N divergent versions — the exact fragmentation the umbrella exists to avoid. The plan ships nothing; the **maintainer-agent implements every slice as small, parallel-stacked PRs, each independently gated** — the per-split-spec decomposition is a **sequencing device, not an ownership boundary** (there are no separate per-feature owners). |
| Two backends coexisting (`:8000` Python + `:8001` Effect) during migration | A total migration of ~20 route groups + 32 Alembic migrations cannot be a safe big-bang. | A big-bang rewrite has no parity safety net; the strangler already exists and works. |

## Sequencing Roadmap (which split specs, in what order)

Foundations first (P1), grounded in the dependency graph + migration sequence. Each step becomes its own `/speckit-specify` → plan → tasks → implement.

- **Step 0 — Fix the backend-ts test gate** (defect; gates-travel principle). Make `@effect/vitest` suites collect, drop `--passWithNoTests`, de-duplicate the test trees. Unblocks TDD on every later slice.
- **Step 1 — Lock the shared contracts in `@pawrrtal/api-core`** (parts, taxonomy, session, gateway façade) as typed `HttpApi` + `RpcProtocol` groups — which **auto-generate the OpenAPI spec, the Effect RPC surface, and the typed client** (the only client coupling). Pure contract; no behavior change.
- **Step 2 — Secrets (Story 5 / Spec M)** + **Sandbox (Story 4 / Spec T)**: self-hosted Infisical injection; the **default `local-confined` driver** (constrained CWD + network-off, no container) behind the `sandbox:runtime` slot, with **Docker+gVisor / Kata / E2B as opt-in tier plugins** (`default:false` manifests). Foundational, low-throwaway, self-hosted. The core MUST NOT import a sandbox runtime — only the `SandboxRuntime` port + the tiny `LocalConfinedRuntime` reference impl live near core.
- **Step 3 — Gateway + provider taxonomy (Story 3 / Spec S)**: normalized parts gateway, capability manifest, bidirectional sessions; the CLI-harness seam. Add the **non-core `@clients/acp` package** (Client · Config · Errors · Schema · Registry; the official `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` wrapped in Effect — `@effect/platform` `Command` to spawn, `Stream` for session/update, `Scope`/`acquireRelease` for subprocess lifecycle, tagged Errors; no `index.ts` barrel, `exports: "./*"`) **+ one host-side AgentProvider adapter under `apps/api/src/Modules/`** — the **successor** to the hand-rolled `agy_cli`/`claude_code_pty` bridges, not a fourth one. Targets: **Gemini CLI (native ACP) first, then Claude Code (`@zed-industries/claude-code-acp`), then Codex (`codex-acp`)**. It declares **`tool_enforcement: enforced`** (the host implements ACP's `session/request_permission` + `fs/*` + `terminal/*` callbacks against Pawrrtal's own workspace/sandbox); `session/update` variants map onto the unified `parts[]` vocabulary; the ACP `sessionId` is the provider-session handle; **known agents = Registry data rows**. **Widen the backend-ts workspaces glob to `packages/clients/*`, and stand up the two empty SDK-foundation packages — `packages/platform` (zero internal deps) and `packages/kernel` (the one-loop core + ports as interfaces; imports nothing concrete)** — so the publishable unit (`kernel` + `api-core` + `@clients/*` + the `paw` agent group) has a home before the loop is extracted into it (Step 6). Then **Claude provider (Story 7 / spec 001)** and **catalog/reasoning cleanup (Story 8 / Spec B)** land on it.
- **Step 4 — Shed dead weight (Story 6)**: remove permissions/budget/telemetry/workspaces (keep logging). Best done before extracting those modules to packages. Also **delete the three app-serving `docker-compose*.yml` + `backend/Dockerfile`** (no more containerized app/API — it's tailnet `serve` over loopback); keep the Docker engine only for the **opt-in Infisical + docker-gvisor tiers**.
- **Step 5 — paw CLI → Effect (Story 2 pilot), as ONE binary with TWO groups**: the **OPERATOR group** (`verify · lab · live-ops · profiles`) is a pure HTTP/RPC client of the contracts — validates them from the consumer side with zero kernel coupling; the **AGENT group** (`new · dev --no-ui · run --payload · build · info`) is **kernel-only by construction** and is the **dogfood-by-extraction consumer that PROVES the SDK boundary** (it imports the publishable unit and nothing app-side; `run --payload` is the CI primitive + non-HTTP dispatch entry on the same kernel). Do NOT split the binary; alias the agent group as an `agentkit` bin only at publish. This is the first in-repo consumer of the SDK arrow.
- **Step 6 — Thin-core extraction (Story 1 / Epic K)**: physically split `backend/app/*` into the package tree; promote boundaries to build-enforced. **This step crystallizes the PUBLISHABLE BOUNDARY** — the one loop + compaction + ports land in `packages/kernel`, joining `api-core` + `@clients/*` + the `paw` agent group as the publishable unit, with the **app→SDK arrow build-enforced** (the SDK imports no app/runtime/host code). **In v1 this is internal only:** NO npm-publish pipeline, NO public `index.ts` barrel, NO independent version cadence — the unit is named publishable-shaped but ships nothing public until the four publish gates clear (contracts API-frozen 2+ cycles · stable Effect pin · 2+ in-repo consumers · an external ask). Publishing is **DEFERRED, NOT CHOSEN.**
- **Step 7 — Capability migration (strangler slices)**: read-only CRUD (workspaces, conversation metadata) → message-write slices → **streaming chat/turn last** (highest risk; flip per-route only after harness + parity gates). Includes the **persistence cutover**: introduce `FileStore`, run the **one-shot SQLAlchemy→file-tree exporter**, and **retire Alembic for app data** — **NO search-index rebuild** (there is no index; search is ripgrep/scan over the JSONL).
- **Step 8 — Surfaces & capabilities**: rich media + verbosity toggles (Story 12), BYO-bot + headless onboarding (Story 13), provider auth (Story 9), active recall (Story 10), transcription/OpenClaw/Mirage plugins (Story 14), operability/versioning (Story 16), mobile (Story 15) — each on the now-stable core + contracts.
- **Step 9 — Deployment & app clients (tailnet + RPC, decided)**: **expose the backend via `tailscale serve` on a tailnet node** (loopback-bound, never `funnel`), **retire Cloudflare Access for app/API**, **website deferred**. Add the **profiles slice**: backend `GET /profiles` + `POST /profiles/{id}/unlock`; api-core **`ProfileMiddlewareService` / `ProfileStore` replacing `SessionStore`**. Create the **greenfield `electron/` workspace** (main window + preload validated `window.pawrrtal` handshake + the runtime entry for the **DEFERRED local path**); the **renderer RPC client = WebSocket to the tailnet backend (v1)** via `RpcClient.layerProtocolSocket` + `BrowserSocket.layerWebSocket`; **mobile (Expo, Story 15)** on the same WS RPC; **electron-updater + in-app `update-downloaded` → AppDialog prompt → `quitAndInstall()`** (state captured first), signed/notarized on the gated runner (macOS notarize = the one `macos-latest` exception). **AUTH reconciliation note:** finish the in-flight cookie-session Effect strangler slice as a **learning exercise**, then land a **follow-up profiles slice reusing the same `HttpApiMiddleware` scaffolding** — swap `apiKey(cookie)`→`bearer`/none and `SessionStore`→`ProfileStore`.

## Done When
