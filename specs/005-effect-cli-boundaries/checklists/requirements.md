# Specification Quality Checklist: Effect CLI Boundaries

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The user explicitly requested Effect Schema, Config, Bun runtime alignment, and local `effect-smol` research. The spec names those as feature constraints because this is an internal developer/agent-facing CLI hardening feature.
- Optional after-specify hook available: `/speckit-agent-context-update`.
